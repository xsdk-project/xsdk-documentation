\section{Trilinos-hypre}
Trilinos also has a new Tpetra-based interface to hypre.  This interface lives
in the Ifpack2 library with the native Trilinos preconditioners.  The following
examples will demonstrate how to take advantage of this exciting new
functionality.

\subsection{Is the data wrapped or copied?}
The Tpetra matrix data is deep-copied to a hypre matrix.
