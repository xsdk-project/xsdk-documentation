In the next example (Program \ref{Hypre_BelosEx.cpp}), we will examine how to
use hypre preconditioners with Belos solvers.

\begin{lstinputlisting}[caption=Hypre\_BelosEx.cpp,label=Hypre_BelosEx.cpp]{src/Hypre_BelosEx.cpp}
\end{lstinputlisting}

\paragraph{Lines 1--86}
These lines are not substantially different from the previous example.  Again,
we set up our operator, solution vector, and right hand side.

\paragraph{Lines 88--95}
This time, we have elected not to use a hypre linear solver, so we only set the
parameters related to the AMG preconditioner.  Again, it is very important to
set the maximum number of iterations if you wish to use AMG as a preconditioner.

\paragraph{Lines 97--105}
Create the hypre preconditioner.  This time, we specify that we would like to
precondition rather than solve, since we will be using a Belos linear solver.

\paragraph{Lines 107--111}
Create a Belos::LinearProblem that encapsulates the operator, solution vector,
right-hand side, and preconditioner.  We also specify that our operator is
Hermitian so that Belos allows us to use PCG.

\paragraph{Lines 113--120}
Create a Belos linear solver.  The Belos solvers have many parameters, but we
only specify the convergence tolerance and verbosity (what information will be
printed).

\paragraph{Lines 122--123}
Solve the linear system using a Belos pseudo-block conjugate gradient solver
with hypre's BoomerAMG preconditioner.
