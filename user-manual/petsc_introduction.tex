\section{PETSc}
PETSc is a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable solution of
scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations.
It includes linear solvers, nonlinear solvers, and preconditioners.  PETSc does
not currently support threads, and it does not support solving linear systems
with multiple right-hand-sides.  While it does not include eigensolvers, there
is an eigensolver package called SLEPc built on top of PETSc with a very similar
interface.
