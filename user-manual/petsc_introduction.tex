\section{PETSc}
PETSc is a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable solution of
scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations.
It includes linear solvers, preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, and ODE integrators. It also provides a variety of scalable constrained and unconstrained optimization solvers.
PETSc utilizes the MPI program model and does not use threads. It does not support solving linear systems
with multiple right-hand-sides.  While it does not include eigensolvers, there
is an eigensolver package called SLEPc built on top of PETSc with a very similar
interface. The library libMesh and the framework MOOSE provide finite element solvers that utilize PETSc.
