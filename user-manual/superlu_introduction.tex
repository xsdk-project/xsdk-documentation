\section{SuperLU}
SuperLU is a general purpose library for the direct solution of large, sparse,
nonsymmetric systems of linear equations on high performance machines. The library routines will perform an LU decomposition with partial pivoting and triangular system solves through forward and back substitution. The LU factorization routines can handle non-square matrices but the triangular solves are performed only for square matrices. The matrix columns may be preordered (before factorization) either through library or user supplied routines. This preordering for sparsity is completely separate from the factorization. Working precision iterative refinement subroutines are provided for improved backward stability. Routines are also provided to equilibrate the system, estimate the condition number, calculate the relative backward error, and estimate error bounds for the refined solutions.

There are three separate versions of this code: SuperLU (for sequential machines),
SuperLU\_MT (for shared memory parallel machines with using OpenMP or Pthread), and SuperLU\_DIST (for distributed memory machines using MPI).

The library is written in C, with Fortran interface.  SuperLU\_DIST supports MPI+X, where X can be CUDA, OpenMP, or both.
