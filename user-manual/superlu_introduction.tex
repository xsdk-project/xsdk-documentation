\section{SuperLU}
SuperLU is a general purpose library for the direct solution of large, sparse,
nonsymmetric systems of linear equations on high performance machines. There are
three separate versions of this code: SuperLU (for sequential machines),
SuperLU\_MT (for shared memory parallel machines), and SuperLU\_DIST (for
distributed memory).
