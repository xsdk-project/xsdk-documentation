\chapter*{Introduction}
The following are the libraries included in the xSDK.
{\color{red}TODO: Maybe each team should write a paragraph or so for this.}

Two of the libraries, PETSc and Trilinos are comprehensive numerical
software packages\footnote{Note that the term ``Trilinos package'' has
  a specific meaning that, here we just mean package in the generic
  sense} that can solve a large variety of problems with both their
own algorithmic implementations and wrappers to other numerical
libraries. SuperLU and hypre are specialized libraries that provide
sophisticated solvers for a restricted family of problems. SuperLU
provides sparse direct linear solvers and ILU preconditioners while
hypre provides iterative solvers for linear systems.

The xSDK provides a common system for installing and working with all of these packages so, in some sense, xSDK is meta-package.
