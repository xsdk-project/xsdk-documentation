Our first example (Program \ref{src/PETSc_AnasaziEx.cpp}) shows how to compute
the smallest eigenpairs of a PETSc Mat, specificially Poisson2D, using Trilinos'
Anasazi package.

Typedefs and using statements to make the code more readable

\paragraph{Lines 30--36}
PETSc datatypes

\paragraph{Lines 38--41}
Get the command line arguments using PETSc.  This example has three of them: the
number of mesh points in the x direction, number of mesh points in the y
direction, and the number of desired eigenpairs.

\paragraph{Lines 43--62}
Create the PETSc Mat and set its values.

\paragraph{Line 64}
Wrap the PETSc Mat in a Tpetra::PETScAIJMatrix.  Since Anasazi only requires a
Tpetra::Operator\footnote{RowMatrix is a specific type of Operator, and
CrsMatrix is a specific type of RowMatrix.  Therefore, you can use a RowMatrix
anywhere an Operator is accepted, but you can't necessarily use a RowMatrix
anywhere a CrsMatrix is expected.}, we do not have to deep copy the data to a
Tpetra::CrsMatrix.

\paragraph{Line 66}
Create a random initial guess for the eigensolver.  Note that we can treat
tpetraA just like any other Tpetra::RowMatrix and obtain its domain map via
getDomainMap().
