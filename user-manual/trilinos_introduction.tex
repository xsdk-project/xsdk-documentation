\section{Trilinos}

{\color{red}TODO: This needs work.  Maybe Jim or Mike should have a look at it.}

The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling
technologies within an object-oriented software framework for the solution of
large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and scientific problems. Trilinos
is organized into 66 different packages, each with a specific focus.  These
packages include linear and nonlinear solvers, preconditioners (including
algebraic multigrid), graph partitioners, eigensolvers, and optimization
algorithms, among other things.  Users are only required to install the subset
of packages related to the problems they are trying to solve.

Trilinos supports MPI+X, where X can be CUDA, OpenMP, etc.
