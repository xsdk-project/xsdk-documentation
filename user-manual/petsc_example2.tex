The second example (Program \ref{PETSc_Amesos2Ex.cpp}) demonstrates how to use
PETSc datatypes with Trilinos packages that require a Tpetra::CrsMatrix.  One
such package is Amesos2, which contains a variety of direct solvers (and
interfaces to external direct solvers).  In this example, we will solve a linear
system $Ax=b$ where $A$ is the 2D discretization of the Poisson operator on a
unit cube, and $b$ is a random vector.

\paragraph{Lines 1--65}
These lines are very similar to the previous example.  We set up convenient
typedefs, read in the command line arguments with PETSc (in this case, the x
and y dimensions of the grid), and set up the Poisson2D matrix.

\paragraph{Lines 67--73}
Create the initial guess for $x$ and the random RHS $b$.

\paragraph{Lines 75--77}
Copy the PETSc Mat and Vecs to Tpetra::CrsMatrix and Tpetra::Vector, so that
we can use them with the Amesos2 linear solvers.

\paragraph{Lines 79--82}
Create an Amesos2 linear solver, specifically the native solver KLU2.  Perform
the symbolic and numeric factorizations, then solve the linear system.
