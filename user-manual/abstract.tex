{\color{red}TODO: This needs work.}

Some application developers need to be able to use multiple DOE
libraries together, such as PETSc, Hypre, SuperLU, Trilinos, and Alquimia.  This
is nontrivial because these libraries all expect the data to be stored in
different ways, and the way that you call a PETSc KSP linear solver, for
instance, looks fundamentally different from the way you would call a
Trilinos Belos linear solver.  The IDEAS software productivity project plans to
address this problem with the Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit
(xSDK).  The xSDK will provide an interoperability layer that enables easy
installation and combined usage of the IDEAS libraries.  This document describes
the various interoperability layers and how to install and use the xSDK.
