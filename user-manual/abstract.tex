Some application developers need to be able to use Trilinos together with other
libraries, such as PETSc.  This is nontrivial because these libraries all expect
the data to be stored in different ways, and the way that you call a PETSc KSP
linear solver, for instance, looks fundamentally different from the way you
would call a Belos linear solver.  The IDEAS software productivity project plans
to address this problem with the Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development
Kit (xSDK).  The xSDK will provide an interoperability layer that enables easy
installation and combined usage of the IDEAS libraries, including PETSc, Hypre,
and SuperLU.  This document describes the various interoperability layers and
how to install and use the xSDK.
