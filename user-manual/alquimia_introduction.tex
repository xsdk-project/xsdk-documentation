\section{Alquimia}

Alquimia is an API for providing mature geochemistry and biogeochemistry 
capabilities to reactive transport codes. It is not a geochemistry solver--it is 
a library comprising data structures and interfaces that wrap chemistry solvers 
from well-established codes like PFlotran ({\tt http://www.pflotran.org}) and 
CrunchFlow ({\tt http://www.csteefel.com/CrunchFlowIntroduction.html}), 
allowing developers of newer codes to use these solvers with a single interface. 
We refer to these chemistry solvers as {\em chemistry engines}.

Currently, Alquimia supports two chemistry engines: PFlotran and CrunchFlow. 
There are plans to support more in the future, depending on funding and levels 
of engagement in the DOE's reactive transport research community.
